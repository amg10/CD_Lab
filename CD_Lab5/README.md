## Lab Assignment 5

Predictive Parser

## How to run the code?

Step 1: The given grammar is written in the file 'Original_grammar.txt' in the way (E->E + T|T) i.e each symbol in the production are seperated by space and there are no surrounding space.

Step 2: Execute 'Rmv_left_recursion.cpp' code , to remove left recursion from the original grammar. The output is aytomatically stored in 'LL1_Grammar.txt' from where grammar is left factored manually.

Step 3: Execute the code 'First_Follow.c' to compute first and follow sets.(Note: The code works when non terminals are single Captical letters and terminals are single lower case letter or #(epsilon).Hence, the grammar two is transformed before giving input.). The First and Follow sets are then manually wrote into First.txt and Follow.txt .

Step 4: Write the Input to be checked in the 'input_to_check.txt' file.

Step 5: Run the lexical analyzer generated by tokenizer.lex . The tokenized input will automatically get stored in 'Tokenized_text.txt' .

Step 6: Finally execute 'Predictive_Parser.cpp' to obtain parse table and check the given input.(Note: Parsing table of grammar 2 being big,it is stored in file Parsing_table.txt to visualize properly.)

The lex tool can be executed as follows:

```
flex tokenizer.lex
gcc lex.yy.c
./a.out
```

To execute the C++ code:

```
g++ Predictive_Parser.cpp
./a.out
```

The trial inputs and results are attached in seperate files.
